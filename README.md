This script combines both NER and QA models so that user inputs can be processed in a much more dynamic way. The key entity, for instance drug names, symptoms, etc., extraction from the queries is done with the help of an NER model; therefore, this goes beyond simple keyword matching. This way, the context can be understood clearlyâ€”the what and where of what the user wants to say. The NER model is not just dependent on a set of static keywords but can identify entities in relation to each other in text to provide structured information about the query. Such structured data can be used for creating a much more focused and relevant context for the QA model, which, in turn, lets the final answer rely on this enhanced input. This technique allows faster and more precise responses in addressing the entities involved in the query made by users.
